# ShowerBlame
Stop it. Stop using water while I`m in the shower. No I don't care that you needed the water to put out a fire. WHEN THE LIGHT IS RED, THE SHOWER IS ON!!!


## A framework for shower logistics

The Idea: Have a button that when pressed, shows a red light at all other water-usage points in the house, showing that the shower is in use and that using water will cause that person to be burned to a crisp or frozen into Elsa. The idea is by making it obvious the shower is running, people can not use the sink for 5 more minutes.
